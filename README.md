**Note:** The whole report with the details of the project can be found in the pdf file above (that is also in the repository).

This project investigates the impact of network parameters on the spread of computer viruses in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. The study uses a randomly generated network of 1,000 nodes to simulate virus propagation under varying conditions, analyzing factors such as node susceptibility, network connectivity, and the effectiveness of security measures.

This was a project for a course on complex networks.

Below are a few videos of the more interesting parameter configurations.
